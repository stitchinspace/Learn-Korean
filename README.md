This is the fourth webpage I've built. It started as a vague and simple idea with a "sticky notes on a wall" feel. You can see that by poking around in the "version 1" directory. A tin of mints inspired a new look, which in turn begged for more sophisticated functionality. So, the project was not well-planned; it morphed, making it tricky to craft the css and javascript well.

Goals: 1. Build a single-page application using the css display property (loading the study page from the start, keeping it hidden until it was called for). This may work okay for simple apps, but my guess is the load time and the complexity of show-hides would be too much for a clean large site.

Make a responsive design without media queries (nothing wrong with them, just trying it out). The result is not perfect on all screen sizes, but overall okay. Due to this restriction I ended up hard-coding some of the sizes of things. I realize this is not generally advisable these days, but the site works reasonably well for most screens currently in use (320px to 1920px widths).

My original goal was to consider mobile first, but that broke my artist heart, so the second version started with the big screen and scaled down.

Things that don't really work: 1. The dictionary is only populated with words I've added through the form at the bottom of the page. Starting off with a decent dictionary would have been better, but as this is a beginner skill-building project I wasn't ready to tackle that yet.

Of course the form for adding a word to the dictionary is awkward and requires a level of understanding I would never expect an end user to have. Ideally using the form would submit an item to a database (with security measures in place).

Needless to say, this is not a super useful site. It's not for total beginners (no alphabet) and not for anyone wanting to learn grammar, phrases, or sounds. The theme of the site happened to be a current interest; the purpose of the project was not to create a language-learning system.

Goals for future: 1. Plan well. Think an idea through before jumping in, or stopping to refactor if things change much. 2. Consider special needs (screen readers, color blind, manual dexterity for clicking radio buttons). 3. Learn about modular javascript and use it.
